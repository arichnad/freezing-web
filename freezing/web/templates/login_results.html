<h2>Uh-oh, something went wrong</h2>
<p>
	So you are a Strava athlete, we get that. Unfortunately, one of these two things is true:
    <ol>
        <li>you are not registered with any of the configured Freezing Saddles teams, or</li>
        <li>you did not give Strava permission for us to "View your complete Strava profile". Without that, we can't see what clubs you belong to.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>If the latter is true, try to login again and grant us permission to "View your complete Strava profile".</p>
<h2>Detailed error message:</h2>
