<h1>Authorization Results</h1>
<p>
	Welcome, {{ athlete.firstname }}.
</p>
<p>
  	You have successfully authorized the Freezing Saddles application to read your Strava rides.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Make sure you have registered on the <a href="http://register.freezingsaddles.com/">signup sheet</a>.
	Note: for the purposes of the registration form, your Strava user ID is <strong>{{ athlete.id }}</strong>.
	</li>
{% if no_teams %}
	<li><strong>You need to join a competition team Strava club.</strong> Or maybe the app just needs to be updated to
		know about the Strava teams.  Don't worry,
	your rides will count but they won't be on any leaderboards until you have joined one of the competition
	teams. 
	</li>
{% elif multiple_teams %}
	<li><strong>Houston we have a problem.</strong>  It looks like you joined multiple 
Strava clubs that are  registered as competition teams.  Here are the problematic teams
(please ensure you are only a member of one of them):
		<ul>
			{% for team in multiple_teams %} 
			<li>{{ team.name }}</li>
			{% endfor %}
		</ul>  
	</li>
{% else %}
	<li>
		<strong>You are registered with a team!</strong>  You are a member of 
		<strong>{{ team.name }}</strong> Strava club.
	</li>
